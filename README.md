### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Sinchan Roy
I am a junior at Delhi Technological University set to graduate in June 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into various subjects including Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management Systems, Operating Systems Design, MERN Stack Web Development and Machine Learning, all with a focused emphasis on software development.

My academic prowess and practical experiences have converged as I actively contributed to the development of impactful projects aimed at tackling real-world challenges. Notable among them are:

- ScreenWise: AI Driven Resume Screening
- Text-Messenger: https://textmessenger.vercel.app/login
- CodeIt: https://codeit-a8965.web.app/

During my tenure in college, I led the organization of IEEEXTREME 17.0, a 24-hour coding competition. Through meticulous planning and execution, I fostered collaboration and innovation among students, resulting in a 30% surge in tech event attendance and a 20% rise in new student memberships. Furthermore, my exceptional performance in IEEEXtreme 2023, where I secured a national rank of 918 and a global rank of 2683 among 17,000+ participants worldwide, underscores my coding prowess, strategic planning, and competitive spirit.

I'm actively seeking an entry-level internship position with an engineering company in software development in India. Proficient in languages like C++, Python, and more, I bring a diverse skill set to the table.

As an eager learner and connector, I am keen on exploring new opportunities and engaging with professionals across diverse industries. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at sinchan1509@gmail.com.
